					<h3 class="center"><b>Career Goals</b></h3>
					<p>In the short term, my current professional goals are quite simple: meet the demands of current clients, and obtain a leadership role in a growing organization. My first priority is pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Computer Science. The second is to obtain a position within a company that would not only allow but encourage me to further develop and sharpen my current skills and help me obtain new ones.</p>
					<p>Overall, my career goals are to be a successful web developer: to create dynamic web applications for businesses that are seeking assistance in creating websites and maintain a working database. I would ultimately like to create my own CMS and be able to create websites and databases within the CMS, whether as part of a project or for freelancing purposes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-5">
					<h3 class="center"><b>Learning Goals</b></h3>
					<p class="left">I would like to learn anything I possibly can about web development and database implementation. I want to learn the many different languages and ways to create clean, responsive websites that utliize User Interface and User Experience designs. I want to know what it would actually take to make my own CMS and to be able to make it function as designed and to learn the ins and outs of implementing a database into any website I make, if necessary, that would conform to the needs and wants of the client on hand. I am aware of the task at hand. In order to achieve this level of knowledge in my field, I must continue to grow as an academic through gaining certifactions and enrolling in new online courses.</p>

					<h3 class="center"><b>Professional Development</b></h3>
					<p>Professional Development I believe is key when talking about becoming a success. If you want to make it in this world, especially in the field of IT, there should not be a day that goes by that you haven’t learned something new. It doesn’t always have to be within in a certain field. People fail to realize that you can keep the mind sharp by just simply reading a magazine or a few pages of a favorite book. Personally, I am always looking to improve and become better than the day before.</p>
				</div>				
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3><b>Avenues for Professional Development</b></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Become more involved in out-of-class projects.</li>
						<li>Ask around work to see if there are any new features to be added that I yet can’t do.</li>
						<li>Read new textbooks and go over my past notes and journal remarks as a refresher.</li>
						<li>Subscribe to online content sources, such as Udemy and Treehouse. They have plenty of online courses that will surely either expand pre-existing knowledge about a subject or teach something new.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>				
				<div class="col-sm-4" style="border-left: 5px solid black">
					<h3 class="center"><b>Professional Development Plan</b></h3>
					<p class="left">As of right now, the plan on achieving this starts with continuing my education. Since I am currently in a position that will allow me to learn and expand my skillset, I am going to start working towards my Master’s degree. While working, I will continue to learn new things outside of work via online courses and freelancing. </p>

					<h3 class="center"><b>Strengths</b></h3>
					<p>My strengths are web design languages, particularly HTML, CSS, SQL, Responsive Design (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. I have worked with WordPress before for a former client, but I am still needing to learn more about it admittedly. I am easy to work with and have always considered myself a team player. If I don’t know something, I have no trouble reaching out for help whenever I can’t figure something out, whether within the company's resources or outside of them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-5" style="border-left: 5px solid black">
					<h3 class="center"><b>Opportunities</b></h3>
					<p>The opportunities that are there for me at this point are online courses that I can either buy for myself or view for free and pursuing a Master's degree. I am in the process of applying to the Master's program at University of West Georgia in Applied Computer Science. A few of those courses include more advanced database concepts, new web technologies, and creating web applications that could model the MVC development strategy. I firmly believe gaining a mentor/coach would really benefit me and my professional development as well.</p>
