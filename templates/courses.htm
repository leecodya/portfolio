					<h4><b>How have I developed as a learner?</b></h4>
					<p>I have developed as a learner in more ways than I thought possible. The expectations from professors to do well as well as being in an environment with my former classmates really drove my motivation when completing the rigorous workload set forth by the professors. These two factors combined allowed me to push myself mentally and physically beyond what I initially thought I could do. My professors always wanted me to learn new things and to keep pushing myself to be better.</p>

					<h4><b>What skills, knowledge, and experiences have I learned in the BSIT major?</b></h4>
					<p>There’s no question the BSIT major has given me not only valuable skills needed for the real world but new experiences that will not be soon forgotten! This major has given me opportunities to expand my mind and skillset by competing in competitions and working with the professors and fellow classmates in order to gain real world experience in my specific concentration. These newly found skills and experiences both in and out of the classroom have helped in me becoming a well-rounded developer.</p>

					<h4><b>How has my experience been integrative?</b></h4>
					<p>No doubt that the many experiences that I have had while attending MGSU have been fun. More importantly, it has really opened my eyes on exactly how everything is connected and works together. While taking my IT classes, I quickly discovered that everything is linked! My experience on a cyber defense team showed me the other side of development, where not many people think about potential problems. But it was because of these experiences that made me realize that you are never through learning. There is always something new to be learned in your field. It’s only a matter of time before you realize what it is.</p>
