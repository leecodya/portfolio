I`m Cody Lee, a freelance web developer who builds amazing user-friendly websites and web apps. My websites are custom written from scratch with clean syntax and SEO optimized configuration. I am a recent college graduate from Middle Georgia State University currently living in Roberta, GA. During my time at Middle Georgia State University, I participated in extracurricular activities that not only expanded my skillset as a developer but also sharpened the skills I had learned in the classroom. This extra time spent outside of the classroom working on my passion aided in my quest and fullfillment of becoming an honor graduate and concentrating in Web Development. I am passionate about becoming the best Web Developer/Designer I can be for myself and for potential clients. In my spare time, I enjoy freelancing and creating websites for local businesses. Freelancing sharpens my skills as well as providing me with an avenue to learn new and exciting concepts in the web development world.</h3><br>
