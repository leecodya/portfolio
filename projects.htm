								<div class="caption">
									<p>This is one of my older projects but has recently had a makeover. Before, this site was using a HTML, CSS, and JS template as its sole structure. Now, it has been modified to have a better UI design, better UX design, and utilize Bootstrap as its CSS framework. These changes allow for a completely responsive, user-friendly website that informs the user of the services offered, work done for previous customers, and contact information.</p>
